## Onchain Proof

### Deployed Contracts
- **ZenythVault:** `0xe377Cb5aAB782315eF5bDa4ABA1be953a7156925`
- **ZenythExecutor:** `0xc6dFd5ad02d877582A4c81840Ab4E944c608021a`
- **Network:** opBNB Testnet (Chain ID: 5611)
- **Explorer:** https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xe377Cb5aAB782315eF5bDa4ABA1be953a7156925

### Sample Transactions
All transactions are verifiable on opBNB testnet explorer:
- Deposits: Multiple test deposits ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 BNB
- Withdrawals: User-initiated withdrawals with share burning
- Rebalances: AI-triggered rebalances based on sentiment + yield data

### Event Logs
The contract emits three types of events:
1. `ZenythDeposit(address user, uint256 amount, uint256 shares)`
2. `ZenythWithdraw(address user, uint256 shares, uint256 amount)`
3. `VibeRebalance(uint256 vibeScore, address protocol, uint256 amount)`

All events are publicly queryable and displayed in the transaction history UI.
